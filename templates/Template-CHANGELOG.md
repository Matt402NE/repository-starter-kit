## AI Assistant Notes

<!--
AI assistants should:
- Insert new entries under `[Unreleased]` until a version is tagged.
- Use consistent markdown formatting and semantic headers.
- Reference related files (e.g., PRD.md, CODING-STANDARDS.md) when relevant.
- Preserve chronological order with newest versions at the top.
